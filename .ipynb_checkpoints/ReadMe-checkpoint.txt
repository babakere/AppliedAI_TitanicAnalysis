To access the notebook, please ensure you are running jupter lab or jupyter notebook. The file is called W1633664_AppliedAI_CW. 

as insurance for my notebook's failure to run, I have also provided an HTML version of my code.

I have also attached a requiremnets.txt file advising the user on what programs must be imported to their device and what version to install.

The data set I used is in the folder "titanic.xls".

When you run the notebook, you may have different results from what I achieved; this is another reason why I also attached an HTML of the notebook.
