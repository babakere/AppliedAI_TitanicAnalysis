# Applied AI Project - Titanic Survival Analysis

This repository contains my Applied AI Project, where I analyze the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. 

## Files
- **TitanicAnalysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis and implementation.
- **TitanicAnalysis.html**: HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing in a browser.
- **titanic.xls**: The Titanic dataset was used for the analysis.
- **Requiremnets.txt**: List of required Python libraries.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
  - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- **Visualization**:
  - Used Matplotlib to create insightful charts and graphs.

## How to View
- Open `TitanicAnalysis.html` in any web browser for a quick overview.
- Alternatively, run the `TitanicAnalysis.ipynb` notebook after installing the required libraries listed in `Requiremnets.txt`.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
